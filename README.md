# M2-Embedded_Smart-Industry-Monitoring-System
Fire Accidents are most concerned issues as it risk the peopleâ€™s life and the whole industrial area. Additionally temperature conditions should also be monitored in order to maintain the goods. The project proposes a solution to monitor temperature and detect fire. ATMega328 Microcontroller is been used as it produce high speed processing. When a fire is occur the fire sensor detects and alarm is produced, LED is on,aditionally notification is also sent to the registered mobile number to take the necessary actions. Temperature sensor is also been used to send the values to thingspeak server in order to monitor and set temperature accordingly.
